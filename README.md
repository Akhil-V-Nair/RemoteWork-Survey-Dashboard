# RemoteWork-Survey-Dashboard
### This is a dataset with survey response from Remote Workers in Australia in 2020 and 2021.

About the dataset
This dataset contains the results of two surveys of 1,500 remote workers commissioned by the state of New South Wales (NSW). The first took place in August and September 2020, and aimed to capture the remote work experiences and attitudes at the height of the COVID lockdown. Once health restrictions were reduced and a return to lockdown seemed unlikely, a similar survey was conducted between March and April 2021.

To be eligible, survey respondents had to be employed NSW residents with remote working experience in their current job. This means that both unemployed people and those whose job cannot be done remotely were not taken into account. The resulting sample represents roughly 59% of the NSW workforce.

The responses are stored in 2 csv tables, one for each survey.

Each record represents a single respondent, and contains answers to questions on:

    1. Their employersâ€™ policies, practices, and attitudes for remote work
    2. Their own attitude towards working remotely
    3. The amount of time they spent working remotely, and how they spent it
    4. The barriers they faced when working remotely, and how they have changed
    5. The best and worst aspects of working remotely
    6. The expectations for working remotely in the future
